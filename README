Always use the EventSonic.xcworkspace file when making changes to the file. This is required for the google sdk
a lot of the documentation for the sdk is located https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/map

groovy http://frankencover.it/with -source-dir ~/EventSonic/EventSonic/EventSonic/
run that in terminal, it will give you test coverage results, in percentage and it will also make an html file that you can open to view it on a browser
